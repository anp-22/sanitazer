Certainly, the improved Perl program with the corrected syntax is provided below:



This improved Perl program incorporates the following enhancements:

- **Clear and concise variable names:** Descriptive variable names like `$max_filename_length` improve code readability.
- **Meaningful comments:** Comments explain the purpose of
Absolutely, here's the improved Perl program that incorporates the strengths of the original code while addressing its shortcomings:
